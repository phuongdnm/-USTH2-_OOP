# [USTH-Second year] Object-Oriented Programing
**Lecturer: Dr.Nghiem Thi Phuong**  

Object-Oriented Programming is a fundamental programming methodology for creating computer applications. Object-Oriented Programming offers a wide range of advantages over procedural programming such as easier debugging, easier code reuse, etc. This course  will provide students with essential object-oriented programming concepts, principles, and techniques in order to create object-oriented computer applications. The concepts will be illustrated using the Java programming language. The topics covered include: objects and classes, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces, exception handling, and input/output streams.

### Sofware installation
> The hardest part of programing is setting up the environment.
##### Install Java JDK:
* What is Java JDK?  
Basically, it is the software developement environment for Java developers.
* How  to instal: You can follow this [link](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/JDK_Howto.html). Java 8 is the most stable, but you can install the lastest version, it's up to you!
##### Install IDE: 
* There are plenty of Java IDEs, all of them are good but I highly recommend IntellJ IDEA. JetBrains provides 2 versions of IntellJ: Community edition (aka free version) and the Ultimate edition.
**Download [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)**
* How to set up IntelliJ: You may love this [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-running-your-first-java-application.html)!
